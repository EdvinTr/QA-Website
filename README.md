# QA-Website
Final project for my Dynamic Web course. 
I had around 1Â½ months of experience with Vue JS at the time I finished this assigment.

## How to install
1. Open two terminal windows
2. CD into both folders (client and server)
3. Run "npm install" in both
4. In the server folder run "node app.js" or "nodemon app.js" if you have nodemon
5. In the client folder run "npm run serve"
6. You can now view the project in your browser at localhost:8080

### Search bar
When a user searches for something it makes a GET request to the backend and will try to match WHERE the category or title of any question is LIKE the query.
The search bar is using a timeout function which gets triggered each time the user types, so after half a second or so of no more typing the GET request is executed.
