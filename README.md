# QA-Website
Final project for my Dynamic Web course. We received the project instructions a day before christmas so this was something that had to be worked on during the christmas break.
My previous knowledge of Vue was very limited as we only had 1 assignment using it (we used a cdn link for that assignment).

Feel free to use this project for whatever you may like, just note that a lot of the things I have implemented have been very rushed as the deadline was so short. I might go back and refactor in the future.

Some packages being used in this project:
Backend:
* Node
* bcrypt
* body-parser
* cors
* express
* sqlite3
* sequelize
* morgan
* joi
* jsonwebtoken

Frontend:
* Vue JS
* axios
* mdbvue
* vue-multiselect
